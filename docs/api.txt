Koala Video Server
=====================

January 9, 2010

Requirement
=============
AAU - I want to be able to either create encoded videos by uploading a video file to the server or by specifying a file that already exists on S3.

Solution
=============
Expose two URLs
  POST api/client/1/videos/upload - for uploading videos to server
  
  Description:
    Allows for the uploading of files to Koala. Once the video is uploaded to Koala, it goes through several states.
    
    Control Flow:
    1. A video is uploaded to Koala.
    2. Koala creates the video objects and sends back an appropriate response. The video state is "queued"
    3. Koala queues the Video job on Resque.
    4. A Resque worker pops the video from the queue and processes the video.
    5. The processing step reads the metadata from the video file using RVideo::Inspector. The video state is "processed".
    6. The video is then placed
    4. Koala creates an upload job to store the file on s3.
    5. Post process
    
        If auto_encode is false
          Koala deletes the file stored locally and stops further processing on this video.
        If auto_encode is true 
          Koala does not delete the file stored locally in order to speed up the processing on this video. 
          Koala creates and EncodingJob to encode the video.
          A notification is sent to the client describing the status of the encoding
